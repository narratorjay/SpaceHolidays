# Space Holidays

I have these aims with this upgrade to the live ISS animation displayed at http://narratorjay.me

- Use Git throughout
- Update ISS icon by the replacing the current 'two white squares with a blue rectangle' 
   to 'three white rectangles' allowing coastlines to show through the solar panels
- Decrease the incremental fading of each historic ISS position
- Add refugee camp locations
- ?
